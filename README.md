## Introduction 

This module is the second of three, and created to provides a simple and yet comprehensive example of integrating SpaDES 
compatible modules. This module is downloaded in PART II of the tutorial [**Creating and integrating simple models in SpaDES**]() and simulates a module that acquires and converts a temperature table into explicit temperarture rasters. The .Rmd file 
of the module was not planned to be knitted for running. Instead, please follow the explanation from the [html tutorial](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/tati-micheletti/EFI_webinar/blob/main/HandsOn.html).

The [presentation](https://github.com/tati-micheletti/EFI_webinar/blob/main/Micheletti_SpaDES.pptx) and [this tutorial](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/tati-micheletti/EFI_webinar/blob/main/HandsOn.html) will be presented on April 15th 2024 at the EFI/ESA [Statistical Ecology Section webinar series](https://ecoforecast.org/workshops/statistical-methods-seminar-series/#details), 
and live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjE6j9Mw_K8). To register for the seminar, please [click here](https://notredame.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_7HIO_OJERCWpVbLEK_q5QA)

## Happy SpaDESing!
